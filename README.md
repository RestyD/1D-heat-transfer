This program corresponds to the problem 3.1, one dimentional heat transfer, from the book "Computational Fluid Dynamics for Engineers" written for J. Xamán
It aims to determinate the variation in temperature in one direction T(x), in a lead bar with homogeneous thermal conductivity and specific heat 
(λ = 35 W / m °C. Cp = 130 J/Kg°C). Consider that only heat transfer occurs and there is no generation of the variable. The bar lenght is 1 m, and
it is constraint to 1st class boundary conditions. The analytic solution to this problem is: T(x) = [(T_B - T_A) / H_x ] * x + T_A.
